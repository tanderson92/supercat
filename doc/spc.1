.SH CONFIGURATION FILE SEARCH
.br
Configuration files are required for proper operation.
These files are found by searching in a number of locations
until a proper one is found.  The directories and file names
are searched in the following order for a file with the
extension ".foo" or if the "\-t foo" option is used.  Also,
if the "\-C bar" option is used it's place in the search is shown.

        \./.spcrc-foo

        \./.spcrc

        ~/.spcrc/spcrc-foo

        ~/.spcrc/spcrc

        bar/spcrc-foo

        bar/spcrc

        SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/spcrc-foo

        SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/spcrc

The file extension is obtained by using the characters after
the final '.' character in the file name.  If there is no
extension then the filename itself is used.
However, if the extension is "log" then additional processing
is done.  The filename, i.e. the part of the path after the
last '/' character, is used up to the first '.' character.
For example, this results in an extension of "apache" for an apache log
with the name "apache.0.log".  This behavior can be over-ridden
using the \-t option.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
.br
SuperCat configuration files have a fixed columnar format for
readability and easy parsing.  There are 6 fields per line
although only 2-3 require entries.  The format is:

.nf
         1         2         3         4         5
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
HTML Color Name      Col A N T RE / String / Characters
#################### ### # # # ########################
.TP
\fBHTML Color Name\fR (columns 1-20)
This optional field specifies the standard HTML color name to
use when creating a web page.  It is only required if the \-w
option of Supercat is used.
.TP
\fBCol\fR - Color (columns 22-24)
This is the mandatory three character color name which may take
on one of the values: blk, red, grn, yel, blu, mag, cya or whi.
.TP
\fBA\fR - Color Attribute (column 26)
This is a color attribute which may take on one of the following
values: '-':normal, 'b':bold, 'u':underline,
'r':reverse or 'k':blink.  A space ' ' defaults to '-':normal.
.TP
\fBN\fR - Number of matches to color (column 28)
This is a single digit number that indicates the number of
matches to color on a single line. '0' indicates all.
A space ' ' defaults to '0':all.
.TP
\fBT\fR - Type of Match(column 30)
This is a single character which may take on the following
values: 'r':regular expression, 's':string, 'c':characters
or 't':unix time conversion RE.  A space ' ' defaults to
'r':RE.

An extended regular expression (see regex(7)) specifies the
pattern to match and the pattern or sub-pattern(s) to color.
The portions of the pattern in parentheses are colored.

The string matches the exact string and color it.

For the list of characters, each character is matched
individually and colored.

The time RE extended regular expression specifying a pattern to match
with one sub-pattern to color of the form ([0-9]{10}).  This
should match a 10 decimal digit Unix since 01/01/1970.  This
number will be converted to the human readable form: MMDDHHMMSS
replacing the same 10 columns.

\fBRE / String / Characters\fR - Attribute (columns 32-)
.SH COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES
.TP
spc spc.c
Colorize file spc.c.
.TP
cat spc.c | spc \-t c
Read standard input formatting type C file to standard output.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLES
Take a look at some of the configuration files delivered with SuperCat
that can be found in the SYSTEM_DIRECTORY.  The following are a few
simple examples of the syntax of the configuration file.
.TP
Magenta              mag - 0 r ([0-9]{2}):([0-9]{2}):([0-9]{2})
Color a time field HH:MM:SS but not the colons.
.TP
Cyan                 cya     t ^([0-9]{10})
Match a 10 decimal digit number at the beginning of a line treating
it as a Unix seconds since epoch and convert it to MMDDHHMMSS in cyan.
.TP
Cyan                 cya   1 t ([0-9]{10})
Similar to above but using numeric count.
.TP
Yellow               yel       "(.*)"
Color quoted string in yellow.
